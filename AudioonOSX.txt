Audio on OS X

***
If you're already using professional MIDI hardware, refer
to your vendor's setup instructions. As long as your midi
device is audible and the default output, Euterpea should
be able to play midi through it.
***

To use OS X's built-in software synth, the IAC driver has
to be enabled. Go to "Audio MIDI Setup" via Spotlight and
go to Window -> Show MIDI Window. Double click on the IAC
Driver icon and ensure that "Device is Online" is active.

You only need to do this once.

Next, you will need to install AU Lab to actually map the
IAC driver to a SoundFont. Download AU Lab from:

https://www.apple.com/itunes/mastered-for-itunes/

and install it into your Utilities directory.

===========

You'll have to do this every time you want to use Apple's
software synthesizer.

===========

From AU Lab, open the "Stereo Out" Factory Configuration.
Change the "Audio Input Device" dropdown to "None". Audio
Output Device should stay as Built-in Output. Next, click
"Create Document" at the bottom of the form and click Add
Audio Unit Instrument from the Edit menu. Select the "IAC
Driver" as your MIDI Input Source, and the DLSMusicDevice
for the Instrument.

A Stereo Mix window should appear. If it does not, switch
to the "Untitled" window, where there should now be a new
column labeled "Stereo Mix". Click on the piano button in
the column to open up the correct window.

At the top of that window, there should be a blue toolbar
with four dropdowns. Open the rightmost one and change it
to "MIDI Editor". The window should change to include the
"Active Channels" section. Select all of the channels and
then close the window.
