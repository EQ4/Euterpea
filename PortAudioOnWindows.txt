Steps to install:

Assuming you have the Haskell Platform, MinGW, and MSYS installed (ALL packages).

Locate your MSYS installation directory. Henceforth, it will be referred to as $MSYS
    * On my system, it is $MSYS

Locate your Haskell Platform's MinGW installation directory. Henceforth, it will be referred to as $HASKELL
    * On my system, it is C:\Program Files (x86)\Haskell Platform\2013.2.0.0\mingw

1) Copy $MSYS\etc\fstab.sample to $MSYS\etc\fstab
2) Download portaudio v19 from the website.
3) Extract it in to any folder, call it $INSTALL_DIR
4) Remove the following lines (near line 135) from $INSTALL_DIR\configure.in
   since they cause configure to crash, and JACK isn't available on Windows

    if test "x$with_jack" != "xno"; then
        PKG_CHECK_MODULES(JACK, jack, have_jack=yes, have_jack=no)
    fi

*** Open MSYS

5) From $INSTALL_DIR:

    $ export CC=realgcc.exe
    $ autoreconf -if
    $ mkdir /painstall
    $ ./configure --prefix=/painstall
    $ make
    $ make install

*** You can now exit MSYS

6) Open Windows Explorer

    i)   Browse to $MSYS\painstall
    ii)  Copy the folders bin\, include\, and lib\
    iii) Browse to $HASKELL
    iv)  Paste the folders here, merging as Windows Explorer requests
    v)   Enter $HASKELL\bin and copy libportaudio-2.dll to portaudio.dll
         in the same directory. Keep both copies.

7) Open a regular command prompt, and run

    > cabal install portaudio

and you should be set!
