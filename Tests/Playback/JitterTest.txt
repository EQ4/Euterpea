Jitter Testing Setup

Required software:
- MidiOx
- A virtual MIDI port

See HaskellOx.txt for details on the above

Setup:
- Play "testValue" using different playback methods sending to a virtual MIDI port
- Have MidiOx map from the virtual port to the MS synth
- When playback finishes, right click on the monitor and select "copy all"
- Paste the output into a text editor. Strip everything from the output except note on/off 
  events and get rid of any leading spaces before the hex timestamps. Save as a txt file.
- Call analyzeFile1 or analyzeFile2 on the txt file.

See JitterTest.lhs for information on analyzeFile1/2.
See PlayS.lhs for various playback implementations tested using the above approach.
