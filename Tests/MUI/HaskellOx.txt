Measuring Latency with HaskellOx

Software needed:
    Keyboard: Proxima Controller or other keyboard
    MidiOx
    Virtual MIDI ports: LoopMidi (multi-port) and/or Loopbe1 (single port only)
    Something to do math in hex and convert to decimal

    Loopbe1 http://www.nerds.de/en/download.html
    Proxima Controller http://zetacentauri.com/software_proximacontrol.htm
    MidiOx http://www.midiox.com/

Setup:
1. Make 3 virtual MIDI ports, either 3xLoopMidi or 2xLoopMidi+Loopbe1. They will be used as 
   follows:
       Port 1 - output port for Proxima Controller 
       Port 2 - the input for HaskellOx
       Port 3 - the output for HaskellOx
       (Note: port 1 doesn't need to be created if using a keyboard)
2. If using proxima controller, start it and set its output to port 1. 
3. Start two instances of Haskell Ox and set them up as follows
       MidiOx #1: map input from port 1 to ports 2 and 3
       MidiOx #2: map input from port 3 to the MS synth
       HaskellOx: map input from port 2 to port 3
       (Note: as a baseline, a 3rd isntance of MidiOx can be tested in ace of HaskellOx)
4. Press a note in Proxima Controller or on the keybaord and watch the output in MidiOx #2.
   You should see a pattern like the following.

       Time (ticks)   Event
       wwwwwwww       NoteOn <-- from MidiOx #1
       xxxxxxxx       NoteOn <-- from HaskellOx
       yyyyyyyy       NoteOff <-- from MidiOx #1
       zzzzzzzz       NoteOff <-- from HaskellOx

   The timestamps are hexadecimal and in MIDI ticks. This gives two approximate latency 
   values from one note press 

       t * toDecimal(xxxxxxxx - wwwwwwww)
       t * toDecimal(zzzzzzzz - yyyyyyyy)
 
   where t=4.16sec is the duration of a tick in MidiOx. 


Hex values can be subtracted and converted to decimal easily with calc.exe on Windows in programmer mode (under "view"). When using a 3rd instance of MidiOx in place of HaskellOx, the latency is typically 0-1 ticks (<5ms).
